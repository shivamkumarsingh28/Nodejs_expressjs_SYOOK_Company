Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications, and provides us the tools that are necessary to build our app. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node.js, making it easier to organize our application into an MVC architecture on the server side. Express also provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including a Router, middleware support, view system support, and more.
