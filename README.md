- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side code in JavaScript.

- Socket.io is a library for real-time communication between clients and servers, allowing for bi-directional communication over a single connection. Together, these three technologies provide an easy way to create real-time applications with minimal effort and maximum scalability.

- Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications, and provides us the tools that are necessary to build our app. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node.js, making it easier to organize our application into an MVC architecture on the server side. Express also provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including a Router, middleware support, view system support, and more.

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data between a web server and a web browser. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. HTTP is an application layer protocol that provides a standard for web browsers to communicate with web servers, allowing users to view websites and access other online resources.

- Crypto is a library that provides an easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting data over the web. It uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm to secure data, and it supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. It also provides support for digital signatures, which can be used to verify the authenticity of data.

- EJS: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language that allows developers to write HTML code with JavaScript embedded in it. It is used to generate dynamic web pages, and it can be used with Node.js or other server-side frameworks. EJS makes it easy to create dynamic web pages by allowing developers to embed JavaScript code directly into HTML documents.

- Nodemon: Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when changes are made to its source code. It monitors the files in the application directory and automatically restarts the application when any changes are detected. This makes development easier as developers don't have to manually restart their applications every time they make changes.
